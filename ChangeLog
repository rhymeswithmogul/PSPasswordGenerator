Version 2.0.0 (December 12, 2020):
- Initial public release to GitHub and PowerShell Gallery.
- Made SecureString output the default, with the -AsPlainText parameter
  introduced to emulate the earlier behavior from the 1.x versions.
- Help!  There's help now.  Plenty of it.

Versions 1.0.0 (2016) through 1.2.1 (whenever):
- These versions were a single script that this author used his own use,
  and probably shared it with a few friends and colleagues. They weren't
  released publicly.
