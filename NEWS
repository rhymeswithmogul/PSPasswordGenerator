PasswordGenerator version 2.0.0, released 12/12/2020
----------------------------------------------------
This is the first public release, so everything is new to the world. If
you happen to have an earlier version, you'll notice that passwords are
now returned as SecureString objects.  To restore the earlier behavior,
add the -AsPlainText paramter.
